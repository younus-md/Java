Static Blocks:
 executed while class loading & only once. are useful if we need to perform any activity while class loading (ex: connect to db, connect to native library)
 To load native library
 static{
 System.loadLibrary("path");
 }
 All static blocks are executed from top to bottom & a class can have "n" number of static blocks

 We can execute a program without Main method & static block
1. Class Test{
 static int r=m1();
 static int m1(){
 S.op("print");
 S.exit(o);
 return 10;
 }
 }
  2.Class Test{
 static Test t =new Test(); when ab object is created instance block is executed
 {
 Sys.out.prnt();
 Sys.exit(0);
   // instance block
 }
  }
 All the above methods applicable till java 1.7
 Static Block Flow From Parent To Child:

Static cntrl flow be executed first
 1.Identification of static members from parent to child
 2.Static variable execution & static blocks from parent ti child
 3.execution of main method of child
 Refer Child class.

 Instance Block Flow:

 If a program has only instance block & constructor & main method

 Identification of instance members from top to bottom
 execution of instance variable instance assignments & instance block assignments from top 2 btm
 execution of constructor

 Instance Block Flow From Parent To Child:

 1.Identification of instance members from parent to child
 2. execution of instance variable instance assignments & instance block assignments in parent
 3.execution of parent constructor
 4.execution of instance variable instance assignments & instance block assignments in child
 5.execution of child constructor
 Refer Child class.
