Constructor:  a piece of code having same name as class used to initialze object not to create object.it is
not a method

public class Hello {
   String name;
   //Constructor
   Hello(){
      this.name = "Younus";
   }
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Hello obj = new Hello();
      System.out.println(obj.name);
   }
}

Constructor name must be the same as its class name
A Constructor must have no explicit return type
A Java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized

Java provides a Constructor class which can be used to get the internal information of a constructor in the class. It is found in the java.lang.reflect package.

Java Constructor	                                                   Java Method
A constructor is used to initialize the state of an object.	A method is used to expose the behavior of an object.
A constructor must not have a return type.	                A method must have a return type.
The constructor is invoked implicitly.	                    The method is invoked explicitly.
The Java compiler provides a default constructor if 
you don't have any constructor in a class.	                The method is not provided by the compiler in any case.
The constructor name must be same as the class name.	The method name may or may not be same as the class name.
