Exception :
Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of programs that disrupt the normal flow of instructions
                                        (or)
An exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program i.e at run time,
that disrupts the normal flow of the programâ€™s instructions.
Examples: divide by zero, array index out of bound, etc.

Are Exception & Error both same?
No, An Exception can be handled using "try-catch" or using "throws" where as Errors  mainly caused by the environment in which application is running
can't be handled using the same. All Errors are unchecked
Exception : ArrayIndexOutofBounds
Error:OutOfMemoryError (will discuss more on this)

RunTimeStack: For every Thread JVM creates a runtime stack.Each &every method call performed by that Thread will be stored  in corresponding stack.
Each entry in stack is called "Activation Record or Stack Frame". After completing every method call, corresponding entry from stack will be removed.
After completing all method calls,stack will become empty & Jvm destroys that just before terminating Thread.

Checked vs Unchecked
Error & its Subclasses , Runtime Exception & its child classes are unchecked

PartiallyChecked vs FullyChecked

A checked exception is said to be fully checked if all its child classes also checked (IOException,InterruptedException..) & its reverse case is
Partially Checked (Exception,Throwable)

Lets look into the below code
try{
line1
line2
line3
}catch(){
line5
}
line4
1: If no exception then line1,line2,line3,line4 no catch block
2. If an exception occurs at line 2 then line1,line5,line4

Length of try-catch block should be minimal
Exceptions can be raised also in catch block & finally block
If an exception is raised in catch block without finally block then it is abnormal termination

An exeption can be rethrown by throwing same exception in catch block
throw vs throws
------------------------------------------------------
throw : used to create an explicit exception object. can throw only exceptions errors not classes. can throw only 1 exception
throws: declare exceptions (not to throw).It is always used with method signature. can declare multiple exceptions


Exception Handling + Method Overriding Rules:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. If Parent class  method has not declared any exception then child class overriden method can declare only un-checked exception not checked exception
2. If Parent Class method has declares an exception then child class overriden method can use same or its subclasses or no exception but not its parent classes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Best Practices:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Returning boolean instead of returning null to avoid NullPointerException at callers end.
Use Checked Exception for Recoverable error and Unchecked Exception for programming error.
Close or release resource in finally block.
Including cause of Exception in stack-trace
Always provide meaning full message on Exception
Converting Checked Exception into RuntimeException
Avoid empty catch blocks.
Prefer Unchecked exception over checked until you have a very good reason of not to do so. it improves readability of
code by removing boiler plate exception handling code
Handle all Database Exceptions at DAO layer
calling close() methods for connections, statements, and streams on finally block in Java.
