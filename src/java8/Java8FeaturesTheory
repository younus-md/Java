Functional Interfaces : Any interface that has only one abstarct method is called Functional Interface. To invoke Lamnda expression we use FI
ex: Runnable, Callable, Comparable, Comparator. @FunctionalInterface annotation is used to mark any interface as Fi
If a parent inerface is FI then child interface is also FI(if it doesnt have any extra abstarct method)

Lambda Expression: an anonymous function. During compilation it is converted to a private method but no seperate .class file is generated
